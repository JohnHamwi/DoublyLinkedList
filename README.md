<h1 align="center">DoublyLinkedList</h1>

<!-- INTRODUCTION: Brief introduction about the project, its inspiration, and purpose -->
## Introduction
The DoublyLinkedList project is a Java implementation of a doubly linked list data structure, enhanced with a unique 'Finger' feature for efficient node access. This project is designed to demonstrate the core principles of data structures in computer science, offering an efficient and flexible way to store and navigate through data.

<!-- DESCRIPTION: Detailed description of the project, its features, and functionalities -->
## Description
This implementation provides a comprehensive example of a doubly linked list, where each node points to both its predecessor and successor. The 'Finger' feature adds an optimization layer by pointing to specific nodes, thereby improving the efficiency of certain operations like search and update within the list.
